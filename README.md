# Spring2023-CS411-Semester-Project

This is the repository for Team 4 in section A4 of CS 411, Spring 2023. We are building a web app that helps you coordinate studying with friends!

Idea: An app to see where your friends are studying on campus (GPS coords/api, Google Maps, Instagram messaging) \[approved\]
We would be able to look at the location of our friends on where they study
We will be using instagram messaging to communicate with friends
- Database: 
    - store previous study locations of users
    - store “friends” or people that you like to study with a lot
    - study time/productivity time
- APIs: Google maps API 
    - Google maps API for location data
    - Instagram API to connect for messaging
- OAuth:
    - can sign in with your google or instagram account
- Decoupled architecture: 
    - front end: website/mobile app to check in when you’re studying/see where your friends are studying
    - back end: process CRUD requests and update database

Delegation of responsibility:
    Jared: Front End
    Bowen: Back End
    Spencer: Database

The requirements of the project are: 
- front/back end
- database
- 2 APIs
