### Story 1

User Story 1: As a user, I want to be able to create an account and set up a profile
Happy Path:
User clicks the “sign in/up” button on the top of the page
User uses 3rd party OAuth to sign into their account
User will input: their name, notification settings, photo
User Allows location settings to be on (so the device can recognize where the user is)

Unhappy Path:
A user tries to create an account, but along the way, something fails. The app will show an error message

Feature Significance:
	This feature is important because we want the app to keep track of useful information for each user to better enhance the user experience. This includes friends that the user studies with, total study time, and more.
