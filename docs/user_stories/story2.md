### User Story 2

User Story 2: As a user, I want to know which friends are studying at the moment, where they are studying, as well as for how much longer they are studying.
Happy Path:
	Once logged into the app (user story 1), the home page will display a list of current friends studying (ordered by remaining study time). A user can click on a friend listing in order to see more information about that friend and their studying information.
Unhappy Path:
- No friend data found	
- no service
- no friends
- failed connection to database
- Show error message “not connected to database or no friends ;(”


Feature Significance:
	This is the core feature that the app brings to the table, and allows the user to see where their friends are studying, who is studying, and when they will be studying until. This enables users to easily coordinate study sessions with their friends.
