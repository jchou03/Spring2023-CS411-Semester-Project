### User Story 3

User Story 3: As a user, I want to be able to notify my friends that I am studying, and invite them to come to join me
Happy Path:
	A user will click the “Study” button on the app to check-in to a study location. This will prompt the user to fill out some information about the study session. It will include:
Where the user is studying (address and room number)
How long the study session will be (end time)
Desired study subject (general studying with friends, or a focus study group for a specific subject)
Then the app will generate sharable link that can be sent to friends (optional)

Unhappy Path:
	The created study session wasn’t created, and the information isn’t stored in the database. This would show an error message to the user that their study information wasn’t able to be created.

Feature Significance:
	This feature is important because it allows the user to easily share their study information with friends and invite others to join.
