User Story 5: As a user, I want to be able to add or delete a friend from the list.
Happy Path:
- Send Friend Request
- search for friend’s profile
- click add button
- “friend request sent”
- Accept/ignore Friend Request
- click “pending requests”
- accept/ignore the friend request
- requested user is added/not added to friend list
- Delete
- Click on the unwanted friend’s profile
- Click on the delete button
- “Are you sure you want to delete this friend”
- Click on “Yes” and successfully remove the friend
Unhappy Path:
- You knew you added this friend and you want to delete him/her, but you cannot find his/her profile in the friend list.
- Click on the delete button but it’s not working.
- Error messages while deleting 
- He/she still shows up in the friend list after deleting.

Feature Significance:
	This feature is important because it enables users to manage who their friends are (and who gets to see their study information) and maintain that level of privacy. At the same time, it enables users to connect with their friends to share information easily.
